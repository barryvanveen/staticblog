Now that 2018 comes to an end, it is time to reflect and make plans for the new year.

## Looking back
I don't usually take time to reflect on the past year, this year is the first time. And I must say it is nice to do so, it reminds you of good (and bad) experiences and provides some perspective.

Looking back, what stands out are the things I've done for the very first time. Those are probably the most rewarding and fulfilling experiences of the year.

Some examples:
* Doing my first machine learning project and learning Python.
* Visiting the USA and visit family that lives there.
* Running my first 800m track race and running a personal best ;)

## Looking forward
Although 2018 was a good year, things got a little boring. That is why my new year's resolution is to try new things more often, both professionally and personally.

On a professional level, this will probably go nicely because I will be switching jobs. After 10+ years at [SWIS](https://www.swis.nl/), it was time to start something new. In February I will start as a senior developer at [Coolblue](https://www.coolblue.nl/en/about-coolblue), an e-commerce company in Rotterdam.

Some of my technical goals for next year:
* revamp this blog
* use Docker for a new project
* do *something* with CQRS and event sourcing
* program something in Go
* create a browser extension

Some of my personal goals include:
* trying out new recipes (seitan, falafel).
* run a trail race.
* ride a 100K.
* start an online business that makes (a little) money.

And then there is something else...

## Becoming an "activist"
Web developers know far better than the average person how the algorithms of Facebook work. We know what kind of data Google Analytics can collect. We understand cookies and tracking people across websites. Also, with a programmers background, it is easier to understand the latest hypes on Big Data and Artificial Intelligence.

Many articles are written about these technologies, voicing real concerns about big companies controlling our lives to ever greater extends.

In 2019, some of my articles should be covering some of these issues. How can you protect yourself against online trackers? How can web developers use tools that are privacy-friendly?
