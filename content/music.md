I scrobble all music I play through Spotify. On [last.fm/user/barryvanveen](https://www.last.fm/user/Barryvanveen) you can see my top artists, albums and songs.

This page used to contain a list of albums that I listened to in the last month. This data was collected from [last.fm](https://last.fm/) using this [last.fm API client for PHP](https://github.com/barryvanveen/lastfm) that I've written myself.

However, now that I've switched to a static site (generated with Hugo), I can no longer use that. I'll try to figure out a way to make this work in the future...
