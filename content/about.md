Hi! My name is Barry. I'm a software developer from the Netherlands 👋

This blog is my hobby project. It's a place to play around with new techniques (like Hugo) and write about it.

Also, it serves as a personal collection of tips and tricks so I don't have to go through StackOverflow for the gazillionth time in search of the right answer.

## Hobbies
In my free time I enjoy:
- 🏃 Running, swimming and hiking.
- 🐦‍⬛ Bird watching, identifying wild plants and insects.
- 📖 [Reading]({{< ref "/books.md" >}}). I've been keeping a list of all books I read since 2015.
- 🎧 [Listening to music]{{< ref "/music.md" >}}). From doom metal to funk. Lots of instrumental music.
