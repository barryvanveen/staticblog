description: "The personal blog of Barry van Veen with articles on web development."
---
Hi! My name is Barry and I'm a software developer from the Netherlands. Since 2015, this is where I blogged about many different things, but mostly about web development.

Over the past 10+ years I have worked in many different projects and in different settings. I love cleaning up old code, optimising site speed and writing readable solutions for complex problems.

Have a look at [my articles](/articles), learn more [about me](/about) and subscribe to my [rss feed](/articles/rss).
